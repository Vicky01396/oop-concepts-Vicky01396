## Testing

To run the test in the project root folder use the following command: `make test`

## General Tips

Here are some general tips to help you approach the evaluation successfully:

1. Read the problem statement and requirements for each task carefully. Understand the expected functionality and behavior before starting to write code.
2. Plan your implementation. Design class hierarchies, define attributes and methods, and consider how the classes will interact with each other.
3. Follow good coding practices such as proper indentation, meaningful variable and method names, and clear commenting to enhance code readability.
4. Test your code thoroughly to ensure it meets the requirements. Consider edge cases and handle potential exceptions gracefully.
5. If you encounter any difficulties or have questions during the evaluation, don't hesitate to seek clarification or assistance from the staff.

Best of luck with your evaluation!
